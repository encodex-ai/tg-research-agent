light (blue) to scatter more than longer wavelengths (red) [1]. This scattering causes the sky to look blue most of 
the time [1]. Additionally, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the light has to 
pass through more atmosphere, scattering the shorter blue wavelengths out of the line of sight and allowing the 
longer red wavelengths to dominate [2]."

clarifier_prompt_template = """
Purpose: Determine if clarification is needed ONLY when two equally likely, fundamentally different interpretations exist.

CORE EXAMPLES OF VALID CLARIFICATION NEEDS:
```
1. "What is a cookie?"
   - Valid clarification needed: Web browser vs. Baked good
   - Both are equally common topics

2. "Tell me about Java"

3. "What is a mouse?"
   - Valid clarification needed: Computer device vs. Animal
   - Both are commonly discussed

4. "What are dams?"

EXTENSIVE EXAMPLES OF WHEN NOT TO OVER-SPECIFY:

CRUCIAL RULES:
1. ONLY Clarify When:
   - Exactly two distinct, equally likely interpretations exist
   - Both interpretations are fundamentally different domains
   - Both are commonly searched/discussed topics

2. NEVER Ask for Clarification About:
   - Subtopics within a domain
   - Level of detail preferences
   - Time periods (unless crucial)
   - Geographic focus (unless crucial)
   - Specific examples/applications
   - Technical vs. simple explanations
   - Historical vs. modern context
   - Theoretical vs. practical aspects
   - Different schools of thought
   - Various methodologies
   - Specific components/elements
   - Different perspectives/approaches

3. Trust That:
   - Users will ask follow-up questions if needed
   - General explanations are better starting points
   - Users will specify if they want details
   - Basic overview is usually preferred first
   - Users can guide the conversation naturally

CONTEXT:
Current chat history: {chat_history}
Current message: {current_message}
Research question: {research_question}

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{{
    "has_enough_info": boolean,
    "reasoning": "Only if has_enough_info is false, explain why clarification between two specific interpretations is needed"

"""

extractor_prompt_template = """You are an extractor specialized in identifying and formulating research questions from conversations. Your task is to analyze the provided chat history and current message to determine the core research question being asked.

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Topic Switch Rule:
   When a user asks a new question without addressing a previous clarification:
   - IGNORE the previous question and clarification
   - Extract ONLY the new question
   Example:
   ```
   User: What is a cookie?
   Assistant: Do you mean browser cookies or baked cookies?
   User: What is string theory?
   ```
   You would return: {{"research_question": "What is string theory?"}}

2. Clarification Response Rule:
   When a user responds to a clarification question:
   - Combine the original question with the clarification
   - Format as: [Original question] (with specifics about [clarified aspect])
   Example:
   ```
   User: What is a cookie?
   Assistant: Do you mean browser cookies or baked cookies?
   User: Baked cookies
   ```
   You would return: {{"research_question": "What is a cookie? (the baked good)"}}

3. Non-Specific Response Rule:
   When user responds with "any", "all", "everything", "anything", "whatever", etc.:
   - Return to the original, broader question
   - DO NOT add any limiting context
   Examples:
   ```
   User: Tell me about stars
   Assistant: Would you like to know about celestial stars or celebrities?
   User: Anything
   ```
   You would return: {{"research_question": "Tell me about stars"}}
   
   ```
   User: Tell me about stars
   Assistant: Would you like to focus on their formation, life cycle, or types?
   User: All of it
   ```
   You would return: {{"research_question": "Tell me about stars"}}

4. Command History Rule:
   When chat history contains commands or non-research interactions:
   - IGNORE all command interactions and greetings
   - Extract ONLY the most recent research question
   Example:
   ```
   User: Hello
   Assistant: These are the commands you could use
   User: What are you capable of?
   Assistant: These are the commands you could use
   User: What is string theory?
   ```
   You would return: {{"research_question": "What is string theory?"}}

5. Multiple Clarification Rule:
   When multiple clarifications occur:
   - Use ALL relevant clarifications UNLESS user indicates "any/all"
   - If user responds with "any/all" at any point, revert to the original question
   Example with specific responses:
   ```
   User: Tell me about stars
   Assistant: Would you like to know about celestial stars or celebrities?
   User: Celestial stars
   Assistant: Would you like to focus on their formation, life cycle, or types?
   User: Formation
   ```
   You would return: {{"research_question": "Tell me about the formation of celestial stars"}}

   Example with non-specific response:
   ```
   User: Tell me about stars
   Assistant: Would you like to know about celestial stars or celebrities?
   User: Celestial stars
   Assistant: Would you like to focus on their formation, life cycle, or types?
   User: Whatever you think is important
   ```
   You would return : {{"research_question": "Tell me about celestial stars"}}

IMPORTANT:
- Always focus on the LATEST research topic if the user switches topics
- Include clarifications ONLY if the user directly responded to them with specific choices
- If user responds with any variation of "any/all", maintain the broadest relevant scope
- IGNORE unaddressed clarification questions
- EXCLUDE all system commands, greetings, and capability questions from consideration

2. Language Requirements:

   - Avoid technical terms in the question
   - Don't use jargon unless it's part of the term being clarified

3. Critical Rules:
   - ONLY distinguish between fundamentally different domains
   - NEVER ask about subtopics within a domain
